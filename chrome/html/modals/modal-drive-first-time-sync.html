                Postman now supports syncing all your data with Google Drive! This is still under heavy testing so I recommend
                downloading all your data before you begin.

                Click connect to give Postman access to your Google Drive account. 
                If you don't want to do it now you can click Cancel.

            After clicking Allow access, close the popup and click the Start button. (You can close the connect popup if it's stuck
            at Connecting...)

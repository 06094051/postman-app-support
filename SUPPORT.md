###Reporting Postman issues###

We’ve tried to put together a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to our GitHub issue tracker. Following this should help speedy resolution of issues.


 - This is for Postman issues only. Newman issues go here - https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues
 - If it’s a sync-related issue, and you want to include personal information like your username / collection names, mail us at help@getpostman.com
 - If it’s a question (anything along the lines of “How do I … in Postman”), the answer might lie in our documentation - http://getpostman.com/docs. There are a few areas where the docs are lacking, and we’re trying to patch this up.


For Postman issues:

1. Use the search feature on the Issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it’s really hard to keep track of them / respond when the issues are solved.
2. If yours is a new issue, try to answer the following:

>
> - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally?
> - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?
> - Screenshots - if it’s a UI issue, a screenshot/GIF of the app acting up will help tremendously. (Tip: For quick gifs, check out http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
> - If the request/response flow is not working, be sure to check the DevTools window (http://blog.getpostman.com/2015/06/13/debugging-postman-requests/ for the Chrome App, View->Toggle Dev Tools for the OSX app). The Network tab will show you the exact payloads for the request Postman sends and the response it receives.
> - Do you have the Interceptor on? (only for the Chrome app)
> - What Postman / Chrome / OS version you’re using.

POSTMan for Google Chrome
=======
POSTMan is a tool to help developers play around with HTTP requests. POSTMan's UI is very intuitive to build complex HTTP requests.

Features include:

1. History of sent requests
2. Basic file upload
3. Key/value editor for quickly looking at url GET parameters or POST parameters.
4. Response time
5. Auto complete for standard HTTP headers.

POSTMan is a fork of the Simple Rest Client for Google Chrome. I will update this README as I get to know more about the Apache License.
